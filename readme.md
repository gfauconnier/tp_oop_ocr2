# TP Openclassroom POO 1

Just my solution for Openclassroom TP 2 of the OOP course.  

I created 4 classes a manager with manages the CRUD, a Personnage class which represent the manipulated objects and 2 herited classes from Personnage : Magicien and Guerrier.  

Magicien class has a method to put other characters to sleep.  

I also separated original code in 2 controllers/views.
